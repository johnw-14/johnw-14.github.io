Welcome to my humble site where I hope to write about some huge issues. I am fascinated by AI ethics and algorithmic justice (and their sprawling connections in our society). This site will host a few of my personal projects as I explore and learn. 

On most weekdays I work as a Data Specialist at STEMCELL Technologies in beautiful Vancouver, Canada. I also studied here at the University of British Columbia, where I completed a BSc in Chemistry. I can’t say I miss the lab bench, but I’m still friends with Math and Statistics. 

Hopefully what I post here will be informative and thought-provoking. I guarantee the external links I post will be, at the very least. Any feedback is welcome. Thanks for reading!

Cheers,

John Wheler (he/him)
